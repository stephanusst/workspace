Question 1
What do you expect will be printed now, when this org directive is added to this boot-
sector program? For good marks, explain why this is so.

Question 2
What will be printed in what order by the code in Figure 3.6? And at what absolute
memory address will the ASCII character 'C' be stored? You may find it useful to modify
the code to confirm your expectation, but be sure to explain why it is this address.

Question 3
It's always useful to plan your conditional code in terms of a higher level language, then
replace it with the assembly instructions. Have a go at converting this pseudo assembly
code into full assembly code, using cmp and appropriate jump instructions. Test it with
different values of bx. Fully comment your code, in your own words.


Question 4
Put together all of the ideas in this section to make a self-contained function for printing
null-terminated strings, that can be used as follows:
...

Question 5 (Advanced)
Complete the implementation of the print hex function. You may find the CPU instruc-
tions and and shr to be useful, which you can find information about on the Internet.
Make sure to fully explain your code with comments, in your own words.
